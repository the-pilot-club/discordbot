# The Pilot Club Custom Discord Bot

This is the bot made for The Pilot Club. This bot has been made Possible by the list of contributers! We also had
some insight by Jon (TPC985). We would like to think this is a good product and is always ever evolving!

If you would like to host this bot for yourself, you may clone the repo and import it to your server. You will need to
use the example .env and config.json to get everything to work correctly.

If you do plan to host this bot for yourself please note, this bot is made by volunteers, and we do this on our free time
and by no means are we professionals at what we do. This is simply made for The Pilot Club to automate tasks and to make
the lives of everyone easier.
